                <div class="intro-description">Mixing the organic and manmade, city photography offers a look at the places many humans call home. Alive in their own way cities mix the human element with the building blocks of modern construction steel, concrete, and glass. With little regard for tradtional aesthetics, urban areas still prove to be places where beauty abounds. Maybe if we were willing to adjust how we percieve things, we could find beauty all around us.</div>
